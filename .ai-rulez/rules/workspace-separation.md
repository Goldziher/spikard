# Workspace Separation

Keep language-neutral logic inside `crates/spikard/src` and limit each binding crate
(`spikard-py`, `spikard-node`, `spikard-wasm`) to thin adapters over that core. When
introducing new modules, register them in the relevant `Cargo.toml`, mirror usage in
`examples/`, and avoid duplicating business rules across bindings.
