# Documentation & Architecture Decision Records

**ADRs in docs/adr/ · Examples in examples/ · rustdoc/JSDoc/docstrings**

ADRs (docs/adr/): 0001 (architecture, layering), 0002 (tower-http, config), 0003 (fixtures, msgspec), 0005 (lifecycle hooks), 0006 (async, streaming). Update when architecture changes.

Code Documentation: Rust rustdoc on ALL public items with examples. Python docstrings (NumPy style) with type hints. TypeScript JSDoc; .d.ts auto-generated by napi-rs. Ruby RBS files with YARD docs. PHP PHPDoc with type declarations and @psalm annotations.

Examples (examples/): Runnable illustrations for Python, Node, Ruby, PHP, WASM. Load fixtures from testing_data/; show error handling.
