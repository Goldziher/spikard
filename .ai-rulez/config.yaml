    Spikard is a Rust-centric multi-language toolkit that provides a core library,
    command-line interface, and HTTP runtime with tower-http middleware surfaced
    through Python (PyO3), Node.js (napi-rs), Ruby (magnus), PHP (ext-php-rs), and
    WebAssembly bindings to build and validate typed web services. The monorepo couples
    Rust 2024 workspace crates with Python/uv, Node.js/pnpm, Ruby, PHP/Composer, and
    taskfile automation, backed by extensive fixture-driven tests to ensure consistent
    request handling across platforms.
