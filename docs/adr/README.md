# Architecture Decision Records

This folder captures concise ADRs for Spikard. Each record follows:

- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated
- **Context**: Why the decision is needed.
- **Decision**: The choice we made.
- **Consequences**: Effects, trade-offs, and follow-ups.
- **References**: Links to code, tests, or related ADRs.

File naming: `000N-title.md` with incremental numbers. Keep the set small and current—supersede or prune ADRs that no longer match the code. Use `TEMPLATE.md` when adding a new record.
